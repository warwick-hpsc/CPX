CPX
==========================================

CPX is a C++ framework to couple mini-apps together. It is primarily designed to help explore and understand different run-time configurations of coupled turbofan engine simulations, including coupled CFD-CFD, coupled Particles-CFD and coupled FEM-CFD. This is done through MPI, although there is a GPU version of the MG-CFD avaialble which can be used.

Documentation is available on our [read the docs](https://cpx-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
